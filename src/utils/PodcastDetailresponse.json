The two have run in the same circles for over half a decade, but their joint collaboration has reached an apex with their three song EP, HARDC0RE DR3AMZ, a dance-floor ready project that owes as much to Berlin techno as it does to Dutch gabber music. Rico and Boys Noize – a.k.a. Alexander Ridha – are also incredible friends with a lot of love for one another, and for producer Reanna Cruz, all of these reasons make the duo’s EP one of the best projects of the year.\n\nOn the heels of Berlin techno being added to the UNESCO list of intangible cultural heritage for Germany, Reanna sat down with Rico and Alex for this episode of Switched on Pop.\nLearn more about your ad choices.

His latest work, \"Decide\" from 2022, serves as a coming-of-age story and a meditation on navigating modern life. Despite strong initial reviews, the album only gained widespread attention two years later when its breakout hit \"End of Beginning\" became a soundtrack for youthful nostalgia on TikTok, casting Keery as an accidental pop star.

And while rap artists can still get number one songs on the Hot 100, it’s a far cry from the peak of trap circa 2017, when Nielsen data named hip-hop as the most popular genre in the U.S.\nSo what does that mean for the future of rap? To find out, producer Reanna Cruz spent all weekend reporting from Inglewood, CA, at the California edition of the world’s largest hip-hop festival: Rolling Loud. Through talking to attendees and catching the weekend’s hottest sets, they learned about the current state of hip-hop – the good and the bad – as well as what the future may hold.\nTo read Reanna’s highs and lows from the festival, check out their Vulture article here. \n\nSpecial thanks to Antonio Cruz for his production help on this episode.\n\nSongs Discussed:\n\nOsamaSon – Pop\n\nNicki Minaj – BARBIE DANGEROUS\n\n¥$, Kanye West, & Ty Dolla $ign – EVERYBODY (live)\n\n¥$, Kanye West, & Ty Dolla $ign – BACK TO ME (live)\n\nJunior H – Y LLORO\n\nNatanael Cano – Pacas de Billetes\n\nFuerza Regida – Enculado\n\nThat Mexican OT, Lefty SM – Barrio (with Lefty SM)\n\nThat Mexican OT – Cowboy Killer (live)\n\nKenTheMan – Not My N**** – Extended\n\nKenTheMan – Poppin Sh!t\n\nKenTheMan – Keep Going (live)\n\nKaliii – Area Codes\n\nAction Bronson & Statik Selektah – Respect the Moustache\n\nDrake, SZA, & Sexyy Red – Rich Baby Daddy (live)\n\nSexyy Red, Sukihana – Born By the River (feat.

      "description": "What do Duke Ellington, United Airlines, and the K Pop group Red Velvet share in common? They've all covered George Gershwin's piano concerto, Rhapsody in Blue. First premiered in 1924, the piece became an immediate hit for the way it blended American jazz with the European symphonic tradition. Gershwin had a number of successes as a composer in his day—his aria \"Summertime\" from the opera Porgy and Bess is by some measures the most covered song ever—but the staying power of the Rhapsody make it a rare instrumental piece that's instantly familiar. Maybe too familiar.\nIn 2024, there will be many centennial performances of this iconic piece, but pianist Lara Downes wanted to do something more than just the sound the notes of Gershwin's score for the umpteenth time. Downes commissioned Puerto Rican musician Edmar Colon to create a new version of Gershwin's composition, one that brought in the full spectrum of American life in 1924: fiery improvisation, Latin percussion, and dance rhythms. The resultant piece both pays tribute to an American icon while adding a new set of modern counterpoint.\nNate sat down with Lara to ask her if she was nervous to rewrite such a canonic piece, why a concerto is like a musical kaleidoscope, and the surprising family connection to Gershwin's musical world she discovered while researching Rhapsody in Blue.\n\nSongs Discussed\nGeorge Gershwin, Lara Downes, Edmar Colon - Rhapsody in Blue Reimagined\nGershwin - Rhapsody in Blue\nGershwin - 3 Preludes: II. Andante con moto e poco rubato\nSarah Vaughan - Nice Work if You can Get It\nSam Cooke - Summertime\nChet Baker - But not For ME\nLouis Armstrong - Aint Misbehavin\nElla Fitzgerald - Blue Skies\nRed Velvet - Birthday\nLearn more about your ad choices.

Through her involvement in bands like Sylvan Esso, Mountain Man, and The A's, and as a founder of label Psychic Hotline, Meath defies the narratives that label success in music. This conversation dives into the systemic challenges musicians face today—from the pitfalls of streaming economics to the trials of touring and beyond.

Maybe you know him from his YouTube videos, or co-writing SZA’s “Good Days,” or even performing alongside Joni Mitchell at this year’s Grammys. Jacob is a musician with thunderous chops, proficient on multiple instruments and with a voice that ranges from bass to soprano. over the past few years, he’s managed to release several records, net collaborations with everyone from Michael McDonald to T-Pain, and become the first British artist to receive a Grammy Award for each of his first four albums. His latest album Djesse 4 is the conclusion to his Djesse quadrilogy, and it features a kaleidoscopic range of style, from Indian sitar to Colombian reggaeton to a haunting Simon and Garfunkel cover. This week, we’re going to take a look inside the work and process of a musical mad scientist – our resident songwriter Charlie Harding sat down with Jacob to learn about his new record, his collaborators, and the beautifully unique way he sees and thinks about music.\n\nSign up for the Switched On Pop Newsletter\n\nSONGS DISCUSSED\nJacob Collier - In My Room, 100,000 Voices, A Rock Somewhere, Little Blue, She Put Sunshine\nLearn more about your ad choices.

Her two new singles dropped two weeks ago, and in the time since, they’ve both climbed up the chart and taken the internet by storm. There’s the barnstorming stomp and holler ditty “TEXAS HOLD 'EM,” which just notched the top spot on the Billboard Hot 100, and the dark horse “16 CARRIAGES,” a autobiographical work song detailing Beyoncé’s roots in Houston, Texas. Charlie and Nate unpack both of these two songs, highlighting their structures, inspirations, and collaborators, from Raphael Saddiq to Rhiannon Giddens. Then, producer Reanna Cruz speaks to music journalist Taylor Crumpton, whose article for Time, “Beyoncé Has Always Been Country” lays out the cultural implications of this sonic pivot for one of the biggest artists of all time. \n\nSign up for the Switched On Pop Newsletter\n\nSongs Discussed\n\nBeyoncé - Texas Hold 'Em, 16 Carriages, Break My Soul, Formation, Daddy Lessons\n\nDink Roberts - Georgia Buck\n\nCarolina Chocolate Drops - Hit 'Em Up Style\n\nElvis Presley - Mystery Train\n\nUnidentified African American Chain Gang - Waterboy, Run\n\nJames Carter and the Prisoners - Po Lazarus\n\nRobert Randolph and the Family Band - Find a Way\n\nVince Gill ft Justus West- High Lonesome Sound\n\n﻿More\nRead Taylor Crumpton's article Beyoncé Has Always Been Country\nLearn more about your ad choices.

The U.S. National Anthem, which borrows its melody from a historic British drinking song, has undergone enormous musical change in the hands of pop music vocalists. Famously, José Feliciano, Marvin Gaye and Whitney Houston each changed the meaning of \"The Star Spangled Banner\" by finding new approaches to the performance. Countless others have followed in their footsteps. Now every major sporting event is an excuse for pop divas to make their own creative interpretation. So who does it best? Or worst? Jan Diehm and Michelle McGhee, data journalists at The Pudding, analyzed the pitch fluctuations of over a hundred famous performances to answer these questions and more.\n\nCheck out Jan and Michelle's full analysis at pudding.cool\n\nSign up for the Switched On Pop Newsletter\nLearn more about your ad choices.

      "description": "In case you missed it, last January, we published this story on the rising trend of sped-up music. It seems like the tempo-shifting isn't going anywhere, so we're rerunning our history and exploration into the phenomenon.\n\nOriginal description below:\n\nOver the past few months, you may have heard your favorite song pop up on the Internet – just slightly faster. You’re not alone: the phenomenon of the “sped-up” remix has taken over social media, with everyone from Lady Gaga to Thundercat getting the tempo treatment. The popularity of the craze has led to millions of TikTok videos, Billboard number ones, and songs becoming relevant again, decades after release. Ever since the proliferation of these “remixes,” the big questions remain: where did these songs come from and why are they here? \n\nOn this episode of Switched on Pop, we explore this exact phenomenon, tracing its roots from Thomas Edison to Cam’ron to vaporwave to nightcore.\n\nSongs Discussed:\n\n\n“Dream On” – Aerosmith (sped up)\n\n“Escapism” – RAYE, 070 Shake (sped up)\n\n“Bad Habit” – Steve Lacy (sped up)\n\n“Miss You” – Oliver Tree (sped up)\n\n“Say It Right” – Nelly Furtado (sped up)\n\n“Bloody Mary” – Lady Gaga (sped up)\n\n“Heat Waves” – Glass Animals (slowed down)\n\n“Juicy” – Notorious B.I.G. \n\n“Juicy” – DJ Screw\n\n“Jolene” – Dolly Parton (slowed down)\n\n“リサフランク420 / 現代のコンピュー |” – Macintosh Plus\n\n“In Da Club Before Eleven O’ Clock” – DJ Rashad\n\n“Monster [Nightcore]” – Meg & Dia, remixed by Barren Gates \n\n“Concrete Angel” – Hannah Diamond\n\n“Witch Doctor” – David Seville\n\n“Oh Boy” – Cam’ron, Juelz Santana\n\n“Cool for the Summer” – Demi Lovato (sped up)\n\n“Them Changes” – Thundercat (sped up & Chopnotslop remix)\n\n“That’s All” – Genesis\n\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.

      "description": "In case you missed it, Wham’s 1984 contribution to the holiday cannon, “Last Christmas,” has surprising staying power. When Grammy-winning pianist Chilly Gonzales set out to record a holiday album, “A Very Chilly Christmas,” most of the selections were over a half century old. That’s because most of our favorite seasonal songs come from the 1960s and earlier. But in addition to Mariah Carey’s “All I Want For Christmas,” Wham’s “Last Christmas” reliably returns each winter. Despite the cheesy 80s synths and drum machines, the song’s harmonies are remarkable resilient, a testament to George Michael’s auteur songwriting method. Celebrated artist known for his solo piano works, collaborations with Feist and Daft Punk, and his musical masterclasses series, Chilly Gonzales—musical genius—AKA “Gonzo,” sits down at the piano to share in the beauty of this nu-classical Christmas love song, as well as a few selections from his new album “A Very Chilly Christmas.”\n\nOriginally aired Dec 2020\nLearn more about your ad choices.

Please give me money.\"\n\n\nThe comedian and singer Matt Rogers understands this dichotomy of the holiday hit—part grotesque cash-grab, part unfathomably genuine cheer—better than anyone. His new album, Have You Heard of Christmas?, mines that tension for tragicomic gold.\n\n\n\"Also It's Christmas,\" the album opener, announces this satirical spirit blithely, with an exhortation to \"play this song seasonally!\" \"Rum Pum Pum\" turns the little drummer's beat into a sexy club anthem: \"Saw your name on the naughty list highlighted in red / Now you're up in the club in someone else's sweat.\" Over the course of Have You Heard..., Rogers poses questions that poke at the edges of Christmas lore: \"Is it weird to hook up on Christmas day?\" \"How does it feel to be the hottest female in Whoville?\" And, \"Why does Santa needs so much lube for his sleigh?\"\n\n\nMatt joined Nate and Charlie to share how his pop writing draws from sketch comedy rhythm, the influence he drew from both Ariana Grande and the Lonely Island, and how he accidentally created a sincere holiday hit in the middle of making a comedy album.\n\n\nSign up for the Switched On Pop Newsletter\nLearn more about your ad choices.
